# Interactive-Frontend-2
## Introduction
An interactive website to allow users to search and look for movies where they can watch some related movie trailers upon clicking from the main page itself or upon searching for a particular movie. When users click on an image/movie, up to 4 videos/trailers will be displayed below. This can also help them to make better decisions of their next movie choice. 

## Demo
A live website can be found here https://rachaelloh.github.io/Interactive-Frontend-2/

## UX/UI
### Project Strategy
| User Stories        | Description   |  
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| 1    | As an avid movie fan, I want to be kept updated of the movies especially those that are popular and upcoming. I can also choose movies that interest me and watch a quick trailer for movie of my choice.|
| 2    | As a person who does not know much about movies, I want to have access to a list of movies so that I can watch the trailers to find out more.|
| 3    | As a general user, I wish that there are such movie finders so that I can find any movies at any point of time and watch the trailers. |


### Project Scope
The website will be designed based on the identified goals and hence placed in the following sections in a main page:
Home page- Landing page 
Search Bar: This will allow users to search for a specific title/keyword of movies where the list of movies will appear on the first row (which is at the Default Movies Row). 
Default Movies Row: The first row of the page displays a list of preset movies in relation to a keyword, which in this case it is preset to the keyword ‘Avengers’. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers upon clicking on the particular movie that they want.
Top Rated Movies Row: This row will display about 20 Top Rated Movies. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers when they click on the movie.
Popular Movies Row: This row will display about 20 Popular Movies. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers when they click on the movie.
Upcoming Movies Row: This row will display about 20 Upcoming Movies. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers when they click on the movie.

## Technologies Used

## Deployment
My code was written using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VS Code serves as the local repository which was then deployed to GitHub. Whenever a new commit is done to the master branch, the deployed site will be updated accordingly. To access the project on Github I would visit the GitHub web page and select rachaelloh/Interactive-Frontend-2. I will then click on settings and click master branch. When the master branch is selected, the deployed website will then be available as a clickable link.

This repository can also be deployed locally by cloning the repository. This can be done by going to the main page of the repository to clone/download directly into the editor of choice by pasting git clone into terminal.
