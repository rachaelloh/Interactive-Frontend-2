# Interactive-Frontend-2
## Introduction
An interactive website to allow users to search and look for movies where they can watch some related movie trailers upon clicking from the main page itself or upon searching for a particular movie. When users click on an image/movie, up to 4 videos/trailers will be displayed below. This can also help them to make better decisions of their next movie choice. 

## Demo
A live website can be found here https://rachaelloh.github.io/Interactive-Frontend-2/

### Project Strategy
| User Stories        | Description   |  
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| 1    | As an avid movie fan, I want to choose movies that interest me and watch a quick trailer of movie of my choice.|
| 2    | As a person who does not know much about movies, I want to have access to a list of movies so that I can watch the trailers to find out more.|
| 3    | As a general user, I wish that there are such movie finders so that I can find any movies at any point of time and watch the trailers. |
