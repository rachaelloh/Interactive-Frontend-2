# Interactive-Frontend-2
## Introduction
An interactive website to allow users to search and look for movies where they can watch some related movie trailers upon clicking from the main page itself or upon searching for a particular movie. When users click on an image/movie, up to 4 videos/trailers will be displayed below. This can also help them to make better decisions of their next movie choice.
